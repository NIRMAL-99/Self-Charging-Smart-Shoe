# Self Charging Smart Shoe
Piezoelectric energy harvester embedded into a shoe with fitness tracking.

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a shoe-embedded piezoelectric energy harvester, which can be integrated into a shoe readily for energy harvesting from human locomotion, and capture otherwise wasted energy generated by the natural movements of walking, running, and general athletic activity. ​<br>
Also, the shoe will act as a fitness tracker connecting to the smart app.

### Major Functionalities
Energy Generation - Generating energy by the natural movements of walking, running, and general athletic activity <br>
Fitness Monitor - Calculating the number of steps taken by the user along with the number of calories burned and monitoring fitness level by a smart app

## Methodology
Piezoelectric Sensor:      Generate AC voltage when applying a periodic pressure ​​<br>
Rechargeable Battery:      Charge the battery using piezoelectric sensors and power the ESP32 and Accelerometer ​​<br>
Step up boost converter:   Step up 3.7V to 5V​ ​<br>
Accelerometer:             Measure the 3D acceleration vectors​ ​<br>
ESP 32 microcontroller:    Process the  accelerometer data and connect with the app via inbuilt Bluetooth ​<br>
